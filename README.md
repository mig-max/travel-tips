React application and integrating it with either your own mock backend or an external API. This means you’ll learn what it takes to make a functional application from the ground up yourself and practice it in a project. This project will be carried out individually or in a group, as defined by the teaching staff.

We designed the project requirements to help you develop a working proficiency with React. At the end of the project, you will have a fully functional React application that you will showcase in your resume to demonstrate your skills and knowledge.

In addition to the technical requirements, you will also be practicing Agile methodologies and participating in Agile rituals during the project’s development, such as daily stand-ups, which you are expected to attend.

Technical Requirements
Your project must meet the following technical requirements:

Create a Single Page Application (SPA), using React, consisting of multiple views.
The React application should be integrated with either a mock backend or an external API and should perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on that API.
Your app should be responsive. It should look correct in small screens (mobile) & bigger screens (desktop).
Your project should be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
Have your project available on a GitHub repository. If your project includes a mock back-end API you should have two GitHub repositories - one for your front-end React application and the other for your back-end API.
Have at least 2 commits per day on your project repository that you worked on.
As a final step, check all the features outlined in points 1 - 3 and ensure they are implemented and working ahead of delivery.
Deliverables
You must submit the following deliverables in order for your project to be deemed complete:

A working app that meets all technical requirements, built by you.
A working app deployed and accessible online.
The URLs of your GitHub repositories (frontend and mock backend).
The URL to the deployed React app.
The URL of the slides for your project presentation.
Present and demo your app during the Project presentations.
